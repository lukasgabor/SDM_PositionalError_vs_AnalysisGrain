**File Description:**

R_Script: Step-by-step guideline for generating virtual species, sampling occurrence data and simulating positional error.
Note that we can not provide the LiDAR data, we used for generating virtual species, because they are owned by Krkonose Mountains National Park (available upon request for research purposes). Thus, we created a `vs` object that can be used to recreate the data. The `vs` object can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j6EuL8klf82xtxZ5OUqZrm-qN3MWK_zT/view?usp=sharing).
